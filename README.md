# Parks (For Enthusiasts) Contracts

This is a project completed over a couple days to investigate and create an Fully On-Chain NFT. This is a derivative of the LOOT Project by @dhof and Trans Loot by @ExistentialEnso

My own changes included

- Multiple Randomised Rides where each ride has different random traits.
- Working with a different amount of traits.
- Editing the visuals of the SVG (Size, Colour)
- Deploying on the Polygon Mainnet (Alternate Networks)
